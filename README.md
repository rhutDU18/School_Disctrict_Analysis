PyCity Schools Analysis
Abstract:
The overview of the school district analysis highlights the differences between charter and district school math and reading scores based against total school budgets and per student budgets. These key metrics compare school performance against both overall, size, budget, and school type to which factors have the largest influence on student body performance. Charter schools often have less students and with relatively high budgets. Although they have lower budgets than district schools, charter schools are still in the top 5 performing school types when looking at reading and math scores while district schools occupy the bottom 5 percent of schools passing math and reading.  One metric that seems to have the largest effect on student body performance was smaller school size.  More school resources given to smaller student bodies shows that high school budgets and student per budget matter less than the type of institution and its overall size. 
 

 
Results:
•	The district summary is clearly affected most be low overall passing of reading and math scores.  They are consistently found to be in the bottom 5 performing schools out of 15. The school summary shows that the type of school a student goes to will influence their rate of success as they higher overall passing rates.  
•	When we replace ninth grade reading and math scores from Thomas High School, we can see that its performance is much greater compared to other schools and it rises to the top 5 highest performing academic body.   
•	Replacing 9th grade math and reading scores shows that Thomas High School is the top performing reader at 97%. 
•	It also shows the wide gap between school type and school scores with charters having a 90% overall passing rate compared to just 53% of district type schools.  
•	looking at spending, Thomas High School is in the bottom 5 spenders in regard to overall school budget however is student per budget is still comparatively high. T
•	Thomas High School has medium sized student population and surprisingly is able to outperform smaller schools with more individually dedicated resources for students.  
 
Summary
	Replacing math and reading scores from ninth grade students as Thomas High School show that its math score increases from 75 to 93 and its reading from 85 to 97%. Also the student per school budget increased too.
